# Awesome Lists

A collection of awesome lists that I, Andreas Langenhagen, maintain to keep track of good things.  
I maintain this repository as a space to put in awesome lists that I create as I go along.

## Lists:

- [Python](python.html)
- [Tools](tools.html)
- [Reads](reads.html)

## How to Build the Project:

Write or change the markdown files.  
Then, build your HTML files manually via `./build-html.sh`.

## Licencse
