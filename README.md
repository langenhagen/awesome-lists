# Awesome Lists

A collection of awesome lists that I, Andreas Langenhagen, maintain to keep track of good things.  
I maintain this repository as a space to put in awesome lists that I create as I go along.

## Lists:

- [Python](python.html)

<br><br><br>

## How to Build the Project:

Write or maintain the markdown files.
Then, build your HTML files manually via `./convert-markdown-to-html.sh`.

Best view the files on a server in order to allow for the session-storage to set the bright/night
theme throughout your pages. Locally, you can run e.g.:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
